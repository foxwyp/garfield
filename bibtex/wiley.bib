  abstract = {A new method for automatic indexing and retrieval is described. The
	approach is to take advantage of implicit higher-order structure
	in the association of terms with documents (ldquosemantic structurerdquo)
	in order to improve the detection of relevant documents on the basis
	of terms found in queries. The particular technique used is singular-value
	decomposition, in which a large term by document matrix is decomposed
	into a set of ca. 100 orthogonal factors from which the original
	matrix can be approximated by linear combination. Documents are represented
	by ca. 100 item vectors of factor weights. Queries are represented
	as pseudo-document vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms,
	and documents with supra-threshold cosine values are returned. Initial
	tests find this completely automatic method for retrieval to be promising.

  volume = {59},
  pages = {1662--1674},
  number = {10},
  abstract = {Wikipedia (the ldquofree online encyclopedia that anyone can editrdquo)
	is having a huge impact on how a great many people gather information
	about the world. So, it is important for epistemologists and information
	scientists to ask whether people are likely to acquire knowledge
	as a result of having access to this information source. In other
	words, is Wikipedia having good epistemic consequences? After surveying
	the various concerns that have been raised about the reliability
	of Wikipedia, this article argues that the epistemic consequences
	of people using Wikipedia as a source of information are likely to
	be quite good. According to several empirical studies, the reliability
	of Wikipedia compares favorably to the reliability of traditional
	encyclopedias. Furthermore, the reliability of Wikipedia compares
	even more favorably to the reliability of those information sources
	that people would be likely to use if Wikipedia did not exist (viz.,
	Web sites that are as freely and easily accessible as Wikipedia).
	In addition, Wikipedia has a number of other epistemic virtues (e.g.,
	power, speed, and fecundity) that arguably outweigh any deficiency
	in terms of reliability. Even so, epistemologists and information
	scientists should certainly be trying to identify changes (or alternatives)
	to Wikipedia that will bring about even better epistemic consequences.
	This article suggests that to improve Wikipedia, we need to clarify
	what our epistemic values are and to better understand why Wikipedia
	works as well as it does.The Economist},

  abstract = {Pursuing a nodal (i.e., subsidiary) level of analysis, this paper
	advances and tests an overarching theoretical framework pertaining
	to intracorporate knowledge transfers within multinational corporations
	(MNCs). We predicted that (i) knowledge outflows from a subsidiary
	would be positively associated with value of the subsidiarys knowledge
	stock, its motivational disposition to share knowledge, and the richness
	of transmission channels; and (ii) knowledge inflows into a subsidiary
	would be positively associated with richness of transmission channels,
	motivational disposition to acquire knowledge, and the capacity to
	absorb the incoming knowledge. These predictions were tested empirically
	with data from 374 subsidiaries within 75 MNCs headquartered in the
	U.S., Europe, and Japan. Except for our predictions regarding the
	impact of source unit's motivational disposition on knowledge outflows,
	the data provide either full or partial support to all of the other
	elements of our theoretical framework. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley

  abstract = {Managing knowledge inventories is the central issue posed by the knowledge-based
	view of the firm. Knowledge inventory management involves acquiring,
	retaining, deploying, idling, and abandoning technologies. Because
	of future opportunities to switch technologies over time, managing
	knowledge inventories requires valuing flexibility. Real option theory
	presents normative conceptual frameworks and pricing formulas for
	valuing flexibility. These formulas assume managers consider the
	full time horizon of technologies as well as all available substituting
	and complementary technologies. This study considers the implications
	of violations of these assumptions (i.e., temporal and spatial myopia)
	for managers' technology investment decisions. Specifying decision
	criteria under alternative forms of myopia reveals possible sources
	and patterns of technology management decision errors. This study
	highlights the cognitive sources of path dependencies and organizational
	rigidities.},
