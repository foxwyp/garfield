  abstract = {Managing knowledge inventories is the central issue posed by the knowledge-based
	view of the firm. Knowledge inventory management involves acquiring,
	retaining, deploying, idling, and abandoning technologies. Because
	of future opportunities to switch technologies over time, managing
	knowledge inventories requires valuing flexibility. Real option theory
	presents normative conceptual frameworks and pricing formulas for
	valuing flexibility. These formulas assume managers consider the
	full time horizon of technologies as well as all available substituting
	and complementary technologies. This study considers the implications
	of violations of these assumptions (i.e., temporal and spatial myopia)
	for managers' technology investment decisions. Specifying decision
	criteria under alternative forms of myopia reveals possible sources
	and patterns of technology management decision errors. This study
	highlights the cognitive sources of path dependencies and organizational
	rigidities.},
