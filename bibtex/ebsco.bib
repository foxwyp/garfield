  abstract = {Given the importance of proximity for knowledge spillovers, we examine
	firms' location choices expecting differences in firms' strategies.
	Firms will locate to maximize their net spillovers as a function
	of locations' knowledge activity, their own capabilities, and competitors'
	anticipated actions. Using new entrants into the United States from
	1985 to 1994, we find that firms favor locations with academic innovative
	activity. Other results highlight differences in firms' location
	strategies suggesting that firms consider not only gains from inward
	knowledge spillovers but also the possible cost of outward spillovers.
	While less technologically advanced firms favor locations with high
	levels of industrial innovative activity, technologically advanced
	firms choose only locations with high levels of academic activity
	and avoid locations with industrial activity to distance themselves
	from competitors. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Copyright of Management Science

	the existence of learning curves in manufacturing and service industries,
	it is not clear whether learning curves also apply to knowledge work

	impacts from accumulating specialized experience in a system, diversified
	experience in related and unrelated systems, and experience from
	working with others on modification requests (MRs) in a telecommunications
	firm, which uses an incremental software development methodology.
	Using multilevel modeling, we analyze extensive data archives covering
	more than 14 years of systems development work on a major telecommunications
	product dating from the beginning of its development process. Our
	findings reveal that the relative importance of the different types

	that is method driven and the other that is psychologically driven.
	Results show that the two mechanisms have different effects on the
	learning behaviors and knowledge created in Six Sigma projects. The
	method mechanism directly influences learning behaviors, while the
	psychological mechanism directly affects knowledge creation. The
	effects of both mechanisms on knowledge creation are complementary,
	yet independent. Findings suggest that the value of adhering to a
	method may lie in modifying the learning behaviors that subsequently
	create knowledge. When a firm adopts a quality program such as Six
	Sigma, the method and the degree of its adherence can shape how the
	firm innovates and creates knowledge. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Copyright

  number = {4},
  abstract = {This paper compares how managers value knowledge from internal and
	external sources. Although many theories account for favoritism toward
	insiders, we find that preferences for knowledge obtained from outsiders
	are also prevalent. Two complementary case studies and survey data
	from managers demonstrate the phenomenon of valuing external knowledge
	more highly than internal knowledge and reveal some mechanisms through
	which this process occurs. We found evidence that the preference
	for outsider knowledge is the result of managerial responses to (1)
	the contrasting status implications of learning from internal versus
	external competitors, and (2) the availability of scarcity of knowledge--internal
	knowledge is more readily available and hence subject to greater
	scrutiny, while external knowledge is more scarce, which makes it
	appear more special and unique. We conclude by considering some consequences
	of the external knowledge preference for organizational functioning.

  abstract = {We compare how people react to good ideas authored by internal rivals
	(employees at the same organization) versus external rivals (employees
	at a competitor organization). We hypothesize that internal and external
	rivals evoke contrasting kinds of threats. Specifically, using knowledge
	from an internal rival is difficult because it threatens the self
	and its competence: It is tantamount to being a "follower" and losing
	status relative to a direct competitor. By contrast, external rivals
	pose a lower threat to personal status, so people are more willing
	to use their knowledge. We conducted three studies. Study 1 showed
	that internal and external rivalry involved opposite relationships
	between threat and knowledge valuation: The more threat internal
	rivals provoked, the more people avoided their knowledge, whereas
	the more threat external rivals provoked, the more people pursued
	their knowledge. Study 2 explored the types of threat that insiders

	linkages that must be accommodated in the design of effective incentive
	systems: (1) outcome linkages, whereby the outcome of one employee's
	task is influenced by that of another; (2) help linkages, whereby
	each employee can directly expend effort on helping another; and
	(3) knowledge linkages, whereby each employee can share job-related
	knowledge with another. We analytically investigate the effect of
	each type of employee linkage, and some combinations of these linkages,
	on the optimal design of incentive systems. Our analytical results
	demonstrate how, by optimally weighting individual-level and workgroup-level
	incentives, managers can balance the need to induce cooperation and
