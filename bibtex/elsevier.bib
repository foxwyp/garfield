  abstract = {In writing this paper, our objective was to use the concept of internal
	market failure to explain why many knowledge management initiatives
	fall short of expectations. We re-examined the conventional view
	of knowledge as a pure public good and developed a typology of knowledge
	as a heterogeneous public good. This permitted us to identify the
	different sources of internal market failure that impeded knowledge
	creation and sharing within firms. We then analyzed generic managerial
	responses to internal market failure and showed how the effectiveness
	of each response was limited by the nature of knowledge as a tradable
	commodity. We concluded by presenting a preliminary framework for
	knowledge management based on the enforcement of dynamic internal
	property rights. The objective of a dynamic response to internal
	knowledge market failure was seen as an attempt to balance individual
	incentives with the need to create and share knowledge throughout
	the organizational.},

	Till now the classical intellectual capital (IC) model and its applications
	has dealt with three categories: human, structural and relationship
	capital. The paper takes a step further in the evolution of the IC
	model for the hotel industry and divides relationship capital into
	two categories: end-customer-relationship capital that only refers
	to relations with end-customers and non-end-customer-relationship
	capital that embraces relations with all the other customers and/or
	partners. Such an approach enabled us to measure the influence of
	each IC category on the financial performance of hotel firms separately.
	The application of this model in the Slovenian hotel industry showed
	positive correlations between all pairs of IC categories. Although
	the total IC has a significant impact on financial performance, the
	study shows that only end-customer relationships proved to have a
	strong direct impact on financial results. The study suggests that
	Slovenian hotel management should improve IC by investment in human
	capital and information technology, both of which are connected to
	the urgent need for speeding up the process of direct distribution
	channels development in the category of end-customer-relationship
	capital, thereby directly influencing the financial performance of
	Slovenian hotel firms.},
