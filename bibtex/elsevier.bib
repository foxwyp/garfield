  abstract = {This concluding article in the special issue of Organizational Behavior
	and Human Decision Processes on the foundations of knowledge transfer
	in organizations argues that the creation and transfer of knowledge
	are a basis for competitive advantage in firms. The article builds
	on a framework of knowledge reservoirs to show why knowledge transfer
	can be difficult and to identify the kinds of knowledge that are
	most difficult to transfer to different contexts. The article develops
	the proposition that interactions among people, tasks, and tools
	are least likely to fit the new context and hence are the most difficult
	to transfer. This theoretical result illuminates how organizations
	can derive competitive advantage by transferring knowledge internally
	while preventing its external transfer to competitors. Because people
	are more similar within than between organizations, interactions
	involving people transfer more readily within than between firms.
	By embedding knowledge in interactions involving people, organizations
	can both effect knowledge transfer internally and impede knowledge
	transfer externally. Thus, knowledge embedded in the interactions
	of people, tools, and tasks provides a basis for competitive advantage
	in firms.},

	of knowledge as a pure public good and developed a typology of knowledge
	as a heterogeneous public good. This permitted us to identify the
	different sources of internal market failure that impeded knowledge
	creation and sharing within firms. We then analyzed generic managerial
	responses to internal market failure and showed how the effectiveness
	of each response was limited by the nature of knowledge as a tradable
	commodity. We concluded by presenting a preliminary framework for
	knowledge management based on the enforcement of dynamic internal
	property rights. The objective of a dynamic response to internal
	knowledge market failure was seen as an attempt to balance individual
	incentives with the need to create and share knowledge throughout
	the organizational.},

	two models is that the latter also takes into account influences
	provided by the context in which each structural component is located.},

	information seeking when students were given that task of designing

	in meeting information goals in one cycle resulted in an increase
	in self-efficacy, which in turn reduced the perceived difficulty
	of information goals in the upcoming cycle. At the same time, self-efficacy
	from previous cycles seemed to provide the impetus for formulating
	more challenging information goals in subsequent cycles. Besides
	this dual role of self-efficacy, the moderating role of IM was also
	evident. For participants relatively high in baseline IM for the
	task, the link between self-efficacy and goal success was weaker.
	However, for participants with relatively low levels of baseline
	IM for the task, goal success has a stronger effect on self-efficacy.},

  abstract = {The advent of artificial neural networks has contributed significantly
	to the field of knowledge engineering. Neural networks belong to
	a family of models that are based on a learning-by-example paradigm
	in which problem solving knowledge is automatically generated according
	to actual examples presented to them. The knowledge, however, is
	represented at a subsymbolic level in terms of connections and weights.
	Neural networks act like black boxes providing little insight into
	how decisions are made. They have no explicit, declarative knowledge
	structure that allows the representation and generation of explanation
	structures. Thus, knowledge captured by neural networks is not transparent
	to users and cannot be verified by domain experts. To solve this
	problem, researchers are interested in developing a humanly understandable
	representation for neural networks. This can be achieved by extracting
	production rules from trained neural networks. Current rule extraction
	approaches can successfully deal with problems with discrete-valued
	inputs but are less efficient when dealing with problems with continuous-valued
	inputs. This paper presents a novel approach to represent continuous-valued
	input parameters using linguistic terms (discretization) and then
	extract fuzzy rules from trained binary single-layer neural networks.
	An algorithm was developed to extract the most dominant fuzzy rules.
	The results are very simple rules that can achieve high predictive
	accuracy. The algorithm was applied to a couple of benchmark pattern
	recognition problems and a real-world manufacturing problem with
	promising results.},

  abstract = {Objective To develop a document indexing scheme that improves the
	retrieval effectiveness for free-text medical documents.Design The
	phrase-based vector space model (VSM) uses multi-word phrases as
	indexing terms. Each phrase consists of a concept in the unified
	medical language system (UMLS) and its corresponding component word
	stems. The similarity between concepts are defined by their relations
	in a hypernym hierarchy derived from UMLS. After defining the similarity
	between two phrases by their stem overlaps and the similarity between
	the concepts they represent, we define the similarity between two
	documents as the cosine of the angle between their corresponding
	phrase vectors. This paper reports the development and the validation
	of the phrase-based VSM.Measurement We compare the retrieval effectiveness
	of different vector space models using two standard test collections,
	OHSUMED and Medlars. OHSUMED contains 105 queries and 14,430 documents,
	and Medlars contains 30 queries and 1033 documents. Each document
	in the test collections is judged by human experts to be either relevant
	or non-relevant to each query. The retrieval effectiveness is measured
	by precision and recall.Results The phrase-based VSM is significantly
	more effective than the current gold standard--the stem-based VSM.
	Such significant retrieval effectiveness improvements are observed
	in both the exhaustive search and cluster-based document retrievals.Conclusion
	The phrase-based VSM is a better indexing scheme than the stem-based
	VSM. Medical document retrieval using the phrase-based VSM is significantly
	more effective than that using the stem-based VSM.},

	Till now the classical intellectual capital (IC) model and its applications
	has dealt with three categories: human, structural and relationship
	capital. The paper takes a step further in the evolution of the IC
	model for the hotel industry and divides relationship capital into
	two categories: end-customer-relationship capital that only refers
	to relations with end-customers and non-end-customer-relationship
	capital that embraces relations with all the other customers and/or
	partners. Such an approach enabled us to measure the influence of
	each IC category on the financial performance of hotel firms separately.
	The application of this model in the Slovenian hotel industry showed
	positive correlations between all pairs of IC categories. Although
	the total IC has a significant impact on financial performance, the
	study shows that only end-customer relationships proved to have a
	strong direct impact on financial results. The study suggests that
	Slovenian hotel management should improve IC by investment in human
	capital and information technology, both of which are connected to
	the urgent need for speeding up the process of direct distribution

  abstract = {The creation and deployment of knowledge repositories for managing,
	sharing, and reusing tacit knowledge within an organization has emerged
	as a prevalent approach in current knowledge management practices.
	A knowledge repository typically contains vast amounts of formal
	knowledge elements, which generally are available as documents. To
	facilitate users' navigation of documents within a knowledge repository,
	knowledge maps, often created by document clustering techniques,
	represent an appealing and promising approach. Various document clustering
	techniques have been proposed in the literature, but most deal with
	monolingual documents (i.e., written in the same language). However,
	as a result of increased globalization and advances in Internet technology,
	an organization often maintains documents in different languages
	in its knowledge repositories, which necessitates multilingual document
	clustering (MLDC) to create organizational knowledge maps. Motivated
	by the significance of this demand, this study designs a Latent Semantic
	Indexing (LSI)-based MLDC technique capable of generating knowledge
	maps (i.e., document clusters) from multilingual documents. The empirical
	evaluation results show that the proposed LSI-based MLDC technique
	achieves satisfactory clustering effectiveness, measured by both
	cluster recall and cluster precision, and is capable of maintaining
	a good balance between monolingual and cross-lingual clustering effectiveness
	when clustering a multilingual document corpus.},

	for valuing knowledge assets at a level of detail that is relevant
	for knowledge management. This method uses the added value and the
	cost of a knowledge asset as the main contributors to value. For
	establishing the cost of a knowledge asset, use is made of activity
	based costing. Additionally some limitations of the method are discussed.},

  abstract = {Knowledge engineering is the "bottleneck" in expert systems (ES) development

	is exacerbated by a lack of specific information in published accounting
	research and accounting information texts describing specific knowledge
	elicitation activities. That lack of information adversely impacts
	the ability to develop cost effective ES. A review from the social
	sciences indicates that knowledge elicitation has been well developed
	by anthropologists and ethnologists. Application of anthropological
	interview strategies can overcome this "bottleneck." Ford and Wood
	(1992) developed a strategy fof knowledge elicitation based on their
	research into anthropology and ethnology. Ford and Wood's (1992)
	four phase strategy addresses the issues of knowledge organization,
	problem representation, problem solving strategies, and tacit knowledge
	to improve the elicitation process. This four phase interviewing
	strategy was applied to an accounting and finance environment and
	a prototype ES was developed. Examples of the questions used to perform
	each knowledge elicitation task are presented along with a description
	of the controls used to assure accuracy in developing the related
	knowledge base. Using this elicitation strategy, allows one to overcome
	many of the problems previously identified with knowledge elicitation.},

Video games are enjoying fast-growing popularity, becoming a major component of young people's social lives and leisure activities. Many players share information and conduct social interactions in virtual communities (VC). The current study sought to examine the relationships between members and leaders in such video game communities using a number of variables to describe the member (i.e., knowledge sharing, usefulness, enjoyability, off-site interaction, satisfaction, loyalty, and intention to use) and the leader (i.e., leader involvement). Based on a sample of 2227 members and 41 leaders in 30 video game communities, the research demonstrated the use of a two-level hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to examine the relationships of VC leaders and members, appropriately adjusted for a nested structure. The results indicated that leaders who engage in higher levels of involvement in VC are more likely to have members who agree with and respond to the community. Furthermore, member- and leader-level factors were significantly associated with member satisfaction: knowledge sharing, usefulness, and enjoyability explained within-VC variance while leader involvement explained between-VC variance. Finally, member satisfaction demonstrated positive effects on both member loyalty and intention to use. The study further discussed the implications of these findings, offering direction for future research."
