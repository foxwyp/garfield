  abstract = {Large and increasing amounts of information are now available both
	on the Internet and on corporate intranets. With the availability
	of these vast networked information resources comes a requirement
	for tools to manage the information and provide users with the information
	they want, when they want it.
	
	This paper describes a system which facilitates and encourages the
	sharing of knowledge between groups of users within (or perhaps across)
	organisations. KSE (knowledge sharing environment) is a system of
	information agents for organising, summarising and sharing knowledge
	from a number of sources, including the World Wide Web, an organisation's
	internal intranet or from other users. Users are organised into closed
	user groups or communities of interest with related or overlapping
	interests. Such groups could be members of a project team, students
	studying the same subject (perhaps at different institutions), members
	of an organisational department, and so on. As well as sharing explicit
	(codified) knowledge, the sharing of tacit knowledge is encouraged
	via the automatic suggestion of, and support for, contact between
	people with mutual concerns or interests.},

  abstract = {Although companies are increasingly developing complex networks of
	connections with their partners and customers and shifting their
	focus towards expanding the knowledge management concept externally,
	research addressing the management of knowledge across organizational
	borders is rather sparse. Our aim in the present paper is to develop
	a typology of cross-organizational networks of information and knowledge
	flows. In order to arrive at such a typology we examine two issues.
	The first concerns the locus of control on the processes that enable
	knowledge flow. The second refers to the tradability of the streams
	of knowledge  that flow among organizational entities. We examine
	four types of knowledge networks: ¡°knowledge communities¡±, ¡°knowledge
	 chains¡±, ¡°knowledge supplies¡± and ¡°knowledge markets¡±. For each
	type of knowledge network, we examine its distinct characteristics,
	study related examples, consider the associated research challenges
	and analyze an indicative case.},
