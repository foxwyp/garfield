	we aim to create an understanding of what motivates people to participate

	forces. Our theory is grounded in the learning theory of Legitimate
	Peripheral Participation, and is supported by analyzing the social
	structure of OSS communities and the co-evolution between OSS systems
	and communities. We also discuss practical implications of our theory
	for creating and maintaining sustainable OSS communities as well

abstract={In recent years, extensive studies of many interesting aspects of virtual community dynamics promoted a better understanding of this area. One of the most challenging problems facing builders of virtual communities is the design of incentive mechanisms that can ensure user participation. However, running virtual community experiments in the real world is expensive, and requires a great deal of motivation from users. In this paper we advocate a system dynamics approach to simulate the overall behaviors of participants in the communities, which can provide insights into the user motivation process, incentive mechanism evaluation and community development. A simulation model for a virtual community called Comtella is presented, and the results are very promising},
