  abstract = {An Open Source Software (OSS) project is unlikely to be successful
	unless there is an accompanied community that provides the platform
	for developers and users to collaborate. Members of such communities
	are volunteers whose motivation to participate and contribute is
	of essential importance to the success of OSS projects. In this paper,
	we aim to create an understanding of what motivates people to participate
	in OSS communities. We theorize that learning is one of the motivational
	forces. Our theory is grounded in the learning theory of Legitimate
	Peripheral Participation, and is supported by analyzing the social
	structure of OSS communities and the co-evolution between OSS systems
	and communities. We also discuss practical implications of our theory
	for creating and maintaining sustainable OSS communities as well
	as for software engineering research and education.},
