    abstract = {Leading business thinkers agree that knowing how to collaborate is the key to future business success. But collaboration is voluntary, and difficult to manage for hierarchical organizations accustomed to top-down control. This article will describe new research conducted in partnership with 20 public, private and third sector organizations into how social software is being used -- and how it could be used to help organizations become better at collaboration. Although there are philosophical arguments around whether knowledge can be managed at all, in practice most organizations attempt to manage the knowledge of their employees, customers and suppliers through a mixture of people, process and technology tools and techniques designed to improve performance and add value. Social software works best without imposed top-down control. The concept of social capital first appeared in community studies and is gaining currency in the business world. Using social software gives people a sense of self-determination and relatedness.},
