  abstract = {With the prevalence and development of knowledge management, enterprises
	today endeavor to explore better approaches to manage their knowledge
	assets. Knowledge assessment is an important instrument for effective
	knowledge management. Because knowledge is inherently difficult to
	assess, we do not measure knowledge directly in this paper, but assess
	its application value shown in the business process. A knowledge
	application value assessment approach based on social network analysis
	is proposed. Two aspects are involved in the assessment approach:
	knowledge workers' power and their recognition on knowledge items
	in a business field. Here, knowledge workers' power in a business
	field is estimated through social network analysis. To validate this
	approach, an experiment is performed on a knowledge sharing platform
	which is set up upon Google Group. The result is reasonable and provides
	an important understanding of the availability of knowledge items.

  abstract = {Effective knowledge creation is very important to enterprises to gain
	and maintain competitive predominance and enterprise knowledge creation
	capability (KCC) plays a key role in achieving effective knowledge
	innovation. In this article, we induce influencing factors of knowledge
	creation capability from five different aspects through analyzing
	process of knowledge creation. After that, by applying the fuzzy
	set theory and fuzzy clustering approach to analyze enterprise KCC,
	a method based on fuzzy clustering is proposed for analyzing influencing
	factors of enterprise KCC. Using this method, the enterprise can
	find out the key attribute set of influencing factors of enterprise
	KCC then the key influencing factors which decide its enterprise
	KCC can be deduced. Enterprises can adjust their strategies of knowledge
	management (KM) and knowledge creation according to the analytical
	result to improve its knowledge creation capability and gain core
	competence. Finally, we provide an application case to illustrate
	the application of the presented method. },

  abstract = {Knowledge inventory management is nowadays central issue as knowledge
	management becomes vital for organizations. Knowledge inventory management
	involves acquiring, retaining, deploying, idling, and abandoning
	technologies. Managers must make investment decisions about which
	technologies should be involved into inventory for future usage.
	Options-pricing model (OPM) has been widely accepted to make investment
	decisions. An alternative technology is regarded as an option to
	switch technologies to deal with future contingencies. This paper
	studies another kind of knowledge inventory problem which OPM is
	sort of inefficient to deal with. An organization might be forced
	to invest in some technology in the future because of some specific
	incident occurs, thus option is replaced by obligation. The characteristics
	of this kind of problem are portrayed and we show why OPM is not
	applicable. We treat the specific incident as an insurance accident
	to organizations and initial investment in some technology as insurance
	fee which can cover the loss when accident occurs. We use actuarial
	model to analyze the problem and give the evaluation methods in different
	conditions.},
