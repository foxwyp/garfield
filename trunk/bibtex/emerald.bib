  number = {2},
  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of the paper is to obtain measure of the intellectual
	capital (IC) performance of quoted banks on the Istanbul Stock Exchange
	Market (ISE) in Turkey for the period 1995-2004 and test the effect
	of the intellectual capital performance on profitability. 
	
	Design/methodology/approach – Data required for calculating intellectual
	capital efficiencies were obtained from the ISE for the period 1995-2004.
	The authors measured the intellectual capital performance of quoted
	banks in ISE using the efficiency coefficient, called Value Added
	Intellectual Coefficiency (VAICTM), and tested the effect of this
	intellectual capital performance on profitability using Data Envelopment
	Analysis (DEA). In addition, three different portfolios were constructed
	based on three different inputs to observe the effect of the intellectual
	capital on investors' behavior. 
	
	Findings – The effect of intellectual capital on profitability on
	the banking sector on the ISE was calculated as 61.3 percent on average
	and Portfolio-1, which uses the intellectual capital measure as an
	input, yields the highest returns among the three portfolios constructed.
	
	
	Research limitations/implications – The study was applied only to
	quoted banks on the ISE for the period 1995-2004. 
	
	Practical implications – The findings allow the banks to benchmark
	themselves based on the level of IC efficiency ranking, which is
	important for the banking sector to develop a strategic plan for
	their future performance. It may also be deduced that intellectual
	capital is an important factor for investors. 
	
	Originality/value – This paper can be considered as one of the most
	comprehensive studies on testing the effect of intellectual capital
	performance on profitability in the banking sector using both VAIC
	and DEA.},

  title = {Intellectual capital reporting between a developing and developed
	nation},
  journal = {Journal of Intellectual Capital},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {This paper aims to examine the patterns of intellectual capital reporting
	(ICR) of large listed firms in a developing nation, Sri Lanka. The
	aim of this study is to highlight the differences in ICR practice
	between developing and developed nations. 
	
	Design/methodology/approach – The paper begins by examining each of
	the top 30 firms by market capitalization listed on the Colombo stock
	exchange in 1998/1999 and 1999/2000. Using the content analysis method,
	it reviews the annual reports of these firms to determine the types
	of intellectual capital (IC) items reported in Sri Lanka. It then
	compares these findings with a similar study undertaken in Australia
	during the same period. 
	
	Findings – The findings in this paper highlight the need for a uniform
	ICR definition and a reporting framework that provides comparative
	and consistent reporting under the auspices of a regulatory body.
	ICR differences were identified between Sri Lankan and Australian
	firms, and it is argued that these differences can be attributed
	to economic, social and political factors. 
	
	Practical implications – This paper highlights important policy issues
	for Australia, Sri Lanka and other nations. These issues are even
	more pertinent in the light of the gradual international adoption
	of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), formulated
	by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
	
	Originality/value – Most papers on intellectual capital reporting
	have focused on firms in developed countries. This paper offers insights
	into comparative reporting practices between a developed and a developing
	country.},

  title = {A framework of intangible valuation areas and antecedents},
  journal = {Journal of Intellectual Capital},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {52 - 75},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Purpose – The paper seeks to develop a list of operational knowledge
	assets as antecedents to a validated common taxonomy of intangible
	strategic value drivers. 
	
	Design/methodology/approach – Qualitative data from focus groups was
	collected to validate a theory-based list. The list contains the
	value generation activities (i.e. performance focus areas) and their
	respective critical success factors emerging from the interaction
	of eight validated intangible value drivers. Two primary questions
	were addressed at the focus groups: What performance focus areas
	does the organization need to focus on?; and What knowledge do employees
	need to leverage within each focus area? Data were analyzed using
	template analysis. Structural equation modeling using PLS was performed
	to develop a theory about the impact of the list of operational knowledge
	assets on intellectual capital and business performance measures.
	
	
	Findings – A validated list of knowledge assets called the list of
	operational knowledge assets (LOKA) was developed comprising 31 categories
	(i.e. critical success factors) grouped into seven value generating
	activities (i.e. performance focus areas). The thematic dimensions
	of each category surface internal views of a business that define
	the strategic and operational value drivers that are aligned with
	organizational performance. 
	
	Research limitations/implications – The list is not an exhaustive
	one but rather a template that can be adapted based on the industry
	investigated. The scope of the study was focused on the high-tech
	federal contractors in the USA. Therefore the results and related
	models of this study are generic in nature. Future research could
	focus applying the study on different environments (i.e. organizational,
	cultural, type of knowledge workers) and compare results. 
	
	Practical implications – The paper could improve managers' understanding
	of the human capital drivers on performance and thus facilitate better
	resource allocation on human capital management practices, technology
	investments, process improvements and business intelligence functions.
	
	
	Originality/value – The list of operational knowledge assets presents
	a first attempt in addressing the lack of understanding of the knowledge
	assets that managers need to leverage at the lowest level of operational
	granularity.},

  title = {Intangible resources: a categorial system of knowledge and other
	intangible assets},
  journal = {Journal of Intellectual Capital},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {406 - 420},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {Purpose – There are several strands that cope with particular intangible
	resources, such as intangible assets, intellectual, human, and organisational
	capital, data and information, knowledge and capabilities. However,
	until now there have been no attempts to define and identify all
	intangible resources systematically in one framework. The purpose
	of this paper is to show how an exhaustive and exclusive categorial
	system of all intangible resources can be generated. 
	
	Design/methodology/approach – Following the idea of comparative analyses
	by grounded theory, it will be referred to relevant approaches which
	can be defined in academic literature. It is investigated how types
	of intangible resources, that share common attributes, can be grouped
	together, which categories emerge, and how these categories can be
	defined. This gradually leads to the creation of the whole categorial
	system based on empirical inductionism. At the same time, the categorial
	system is created based on logical deductionism. Having defined intangible
	resources as the objects of reasoning and by which leading principles
	will be looked at, the class of intangible resources will be broken
	down into categories or sub-classes with the help of precisely formulated
	attributes. 
	
	Findings – Generation of a comprehensive, consistent, and complete
	categorial system of all possible types of intangible assets. 
	
	Research limitations/implications – Solely a theoretical paper. Although
	empirical examples are provided it might be interesting to demonstrate
	the application of this categorial system. 
	
	Practical implications – With such a categorial system we are in the
	position to identify and locate the uncountable number of “real world”
	types of intangible resources more precisely and efficiently. 
	
	Originality/value – With such an attempt it may become clearer how
	to cope with different types of intangible resources, how to gather,
	create, use, share and develop them more appropriately.},

  title = {Intellectual capital and capital markets: additional evidence},
  journal = {Journal of Intellectual Capital},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {216 - 235},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to first examine whether intellectual
	capital (IC) information is considered in firm valuation. Next, to
	examine two issues: financial analysts' investment recommendations
	when faced with different combinations of performance levels (i.e.
	above or below industry average) of financial and IC measures, and
	the role of financial and IC measures with different performance
	levels and holding periods (i.e. short-term vs long-term) for the
	investment on analysts' recommendations. 
	
	Design/methodology/approach – The first part of the paper used secondary
	(both archival and survey) data. The second part was an experiment.
	
	
	Findings – The findings in the first part show that, after controlling
	for the effect of financial performances on firm value, measures
	of IC are still significant explanatory variables (of firm value).
	The second part shows that the financial and IC measures affect financial
	analysts' investment recommendations differently depending on the
	measures' levels of performance and the time horizon for holding
	the investments. 
	
	Research limitations/implications – The limitations of the paper are
	as follows: the use of secondary data from a single country limits
	its generalizability; and the results of the experiment are parameterized
	by the research design such as the amount of information provided
	to the financial analysts. Extending the analyses to other settings
	and using time-series data represent future research opportunities.
	
	
	Originality/value – The research makes three contributions to the
	IC literature. First, it extends the studies on the relevance of
	IC in capital market research by broadening its scope to include
	measures of IC other than R&D intensity. Next, it provides evidence
	of the informativeness of IC measures in market valuation of firms
	and analysts' recommendations, thus lending credence to the arguments
	of reports and researchers for more external communication of IC
	information. Finally, this study is one of the first to examine a
	broader scope of IC in the capital market context and the use of
	IC by sophisticated market participants. With policy-makers and standard-setting
	bodies considering proposals to enhance information on IC in financial
	reports, it is important to broaden the scope of IC metrics and understand
	their role in enhancing firm value to develop a framework for reporting
	IC.},

	Exchange announcements},
  journal = {Journal of Intellectual Capital},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {236 - 255},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine an alternative way
	by which firms can disclose their intellectual capital to external
	stakeholders who have an influence on their share price. 
	
	Design/methodology/approach – The paper shows that, by applying the
	empirical “event studies” methodology for the 2004-2005 financial
	year, the components of intellectual capital are used to classify
	price-sensitive company announcements to the Australian Stock Exchange
	(ASX), and to examine any relationship between the disclosure of
	intellectual capital and the cumulative abnormal return of a firm's
	share price. 
	
	Findings – The disclosure of intellectual capital elements in price
	sensitive company announcements can have an effect on the cumulative
	abnormal return of a firm's share price. The market is found to be
	most responsive to disclosures of “internal capital” elements. 
	
	Research limitations/implications – The paper is limited to an analysis
	of the Australian stock market for a one-year period. It does not
	take into account the timing of announcement as a variable nor does
	it consider differences in regulation or operations pertaining to
	other stock markets. 
	
	Practical implications – Researchers and practitioners are now informed
	that price-sensitive disclosures to the market containing intellectual
	capital elements have a marginal effect on the subsequent market
	valuation of a firm beyond traditional financial reports and external
	intellectual capital reports. 
	
	Originality/value – The paper is the first to examine the disclosure
	of price-sensitive stock market information from an intellectual
	capital perspective, using Australian data.},

  number = {2},
  abstract = {Purpose – This paper seeks to provide an empirical view of the present
	state of intellectual capital (IC) in Finnish companies. It also
	examines the relationship between the concepts value of IC and efficiency
	of IC. 
	
	Design/methodology/approach – Calculated Intangible Value (CIV), which
	measures the monetary value of IC, and Value Added Intellectual Coefficient
	(VAICTM), which describes how a company's IC adds value to the company,
	were applied to approximately 20,000 companies per year during the
	period 2001-2003 and studied using correlation analysis. 
	
	Findings – Value and efficiency of IC are described in 11 industries
	in both SMEs and large companies. The theoretically unclear relationship
	between the value and efficiency of IC remains vague even after the
	empirical analysis. Calculating the value of IC in relative terms
	by dividing the value of a company's IC by the value of its tangible
	assets was found to be illustrative in comparing different industries.
	
	
	Research limitations/implications – The measures used are based on
	financial statement information and their validity is questionable.
	However, the large set of data examined has a positive effect on
	the reliability of the study. 
	
	Practical implications – The results in this paper highlight the absolute
	or relative value, and thus importance, of IC for a company, depending
	on the industry. 
	
	Originality/value – The industry level analysis of IC and the implementation
	of scarcely used CIV measure in a large set of companies enhance
	the existing knowledge of the measurement of IC. The analysis of
	the relationship between CIV and VAICTM measures has not previously
	been done.},

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the points of convergence
	between intellectual capital and corporate responsibility reports
	with a focus on human capital issues. 
	
	Design/methodology/approach – To investigate this degree of integration
	the paper analyzes the common elements between human capital accounting
	and the Global Reporting Initiative Guidelines 2002. The assessment
	methodology consists of a study of which indicators for employees
	proposed in GRI guidelines are frequently used in 20 international
	best practices for intellectual capital reports. 
	
	Findings – Results show a large overlapping of indicators around three
	issues: the description of human capital, the reporting on diversity
	and opportunity, and the measurement of the quality and intensity
	of training. 
	
	Research limitations/implications – The research is focused on human
	capital that is one of the three dimensions of intellectual capital.
	It could also be interesting to study the points of convergence between
	corporate responsibility and the remaining two dimensions of intellectual
	capital: network capital and organizational capital. 
	
	Practical implications – The results demonstrate that the opportunity

  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to develop and apply a framework
	that examines the effectiveness and efficiency of managing knowledge

	Design/methodology/approach – Reviews knowledge management and strategic
	cost management literatures to identify key elements that determine
	and facilitate the enhancement of competitive advantage. Develops
	a cost-knowledge management (CKM) framework that integrates these
	elements and enables the analysis of how knowledge utilization in

	Findings – The CKM framework is usefully applied to a sample of four
	Italian firms operating in the mechanical industry. Both the results
	of applying the CKM framework and the insights that are generated
	are discussed. 
	
	Practical implications – The CKM framework allows organizations to
	analyze the activities performed in terms of cost structure and cost
	drivers, value created, and knowledge utilized, the latter in terms
	of knowledge specificity and type. The framework can also be used
	to highlight specific areas of effectiveness improvements in terms

	can be better mobilized. In addition, the framework enables an assessment
	of the non value added but required and waste elements of organizational

  volume = {7},
  pages = {291 - 308},
  number = {3},
  abstract = {Purpose – The aim of this paper is to discuss intellectual capital
	(IC) from a valuation perspective and examine the nature of such
	capital and why traditional valuation methods fail to reflect the
	unique characteristics of IC and propose an alternative approach
	that captures them. 
	
	Design/methodology/approach – The paper builds on the existing literature
	in the fields of financial valuation and IC. The analysis of these
	fields allows us to combine them and discuss the possible usage and
	limitations of real option models for the assessment of intellectual
	capital in firms. 
	
	Findings – A valuation perspective is developed based on the real
	option models that have been extended from their origin in financial
	asset valuation to the valuation of firms' growth opportunities.
	Intellectual resources embody these opportunities contributing to
	both their evolution over time and their realisation in future. A
	typology of IC is developed based on the influence upon the various
	valuation parameters of real options. This approach provides a richer
	framework to analyse the relationship between IC and corporate value.
	
	
	Practical implications – Clarification of the relationship between
	IC and managerial flexibility as a source of value will help managers
	understand how they can create and leverage such flexibility to create
	value. The paper enables managers to understand how different types
	of IC impact on risk taking, timing of investment projects and the
	value of speculative investments. 
	
	Originality/value – The paper clarifies the nature of IC in the way
	it contributes to managerial flexibility to gain competitive advantage
	and exploit growth opportunities. It extends the real options valuation
	framework to the valuation of intellectual assets thus providing
	a link among intellectual assets, business strategy and firm value.},
