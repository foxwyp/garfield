	firms' location choices expecting differences in firms' strategies.
	Firms will locate to maximize their net spillovers as a function
	of locations' knowledge activity, their own capabilities, and competitors'
	anticipated actions. Using new entrants into the United States from
	1985 to 1994, we find that firms favor locations with academic innovative
	activity. Other results highlight differences in firms' location
	strategies suggesting that firms consider not only gains from inward
	knowledge spillovers but also the possible cost of outward spillovers.
	While less technologically advanced firms favor locations with high
	levels of industrial innovative activity, technologically advanced
	firms choose only locations with high levels of academic activity
	and avoid locations with industrial activity to distance themselves
	from competitors. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Copyright of Management Science

	are also prevalent. Two complementary case studies and survey data
	from managers demonstrate the phenomenon of valuing external knowledge
	more highly than internal knowledge and reveal some mechanisms through
	which this process occurs. We found evidence that the preference
	for outsider knowledge is the result of managerial responses to (1)
	the contrasting status implications of learning from internal versus
	external competitors, and (2) the availability of scarcity of knowledge--internal
	knowledge is more readily available and hence subject to greater
	scrutiny, while external knowledge is more scarce, which makes it
	appear more special and unique. We conclude by considering some consequences
	of the external knowledge preference for organizational functioning.

	pose a lower threat to personal status, so people are more willing

abstract = {Organizations in many different industries employ virtual teams in a variety of contexts, including research and development, customer support, software development, and product design. Many virtual teams are geographically and culturally dispersed in order to facilitate around-the-clock work and to allow the most qualified individuals to be assigned to a project team. As such dispersion increases, virtual teams tend to experience greater and more diverse conflict compared to co-located teams. Since the dynamics of virtual team leadership are not yet well understood, research that examines how team leaders alleviate threats to team cohesion and provide strategies for conflict resolution makes significant contributions to the literature. Our study uses a survey-based methodology to examine the perceptions of 159 virtual team members employed by a large U.S. telecommunications corporation and five Korean firms involved in construction, finance, business consulting, sales, and distribution. The study integrates the dynamic model of conflict in distributed teams with the behavioral complexity in leadership theory to investigate the roles that virtual team leaders must effectively employ to reduce various forms of virtual team conflict. Our findings indicate that communication technologies are effective in reducing task conflict; however, the team leader may also mitigate task conflict by assuming the role of monitor. Likewise, process conflict may be abated in the virtual team as the leader performs coordinator activities. An effective virtual team leader exhibits specific roles to manage different types of conflict and the leader's response to conflict plays an important part in virtual team success.

abstract = {This research empirically examines the influence of psychological safety on knowledge sharing among coworkers in manufacturing and service operations contexts. Reconciling conflicting findings in the literature, we demonstrate that whereas psychological safety is an important antecedent of knowledge sharing, the relationship between psychological safety and knowledge sharing is moderated by the level of confidence that employees have in what they know. The greater this confidence, the lesser is the importance of psychological safety in facilitating knowledge sharing. Linking this result to social network theory, we find that psychological safety increases with the frequency of communication among coworkers and that the confidence of employees in their knowledge is related to the codifiability of the knowledge involved. We further investigate direct and indirect antecedents of psychological safety. This research offers insights into actions that managers can take to enhance psychological safety and, consequently, motivate their employees to share knowledge.
