  abstract = {Given the importance of proximity for knowledge spillovers, we examine
	firms' location choices expecting differences in firms' strategies.
	Firms will locate to maximize their net spillovers as a function
	of locations' knowledge activity, their own capabilities, and competitors'
	anticipated actions. Using new entrants into the United States from
	1985 to 1994, we find that firms favor locations with academic innovative
	activity. Other results highlight differences in firms' location
	strategies suggesting that firms consider not only gains from inward
	knowledge spillovers but also the possible cost of outward spillovers.
	While less technologically advanced firms favor locations with high
	levels of industrial innovative activity, technologically advanced
	firms choose only locations with high levels of academic activity
	and avoid locations with industrial activity to distance themselves
	from competitors. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR Copyright of Management Science

	psychological mechanism directly affects knowledge creation. The
	effects of both mechanisms on knowledge creation are complementary,

	The solution approach we propose for this assignment problem maximizes
	the number of proposal pairs that will be evaluated by one or more
	reviewers. This new approach should facilitate meaningful aggregation
	of partial rankings of subsets of proposals by multiple reviewers
	into a consensus ranking. We offer two ways to implement the approach:
	an integer-programming set-covering model and a heuristic procedure.
	The effectiveness and efficiency of the two models are tested through

	on work teams, computer-mediated communication groups, cross-cultural
	communication, and interpersonal and organizational trust. To explore
	these challenges empirically, we report on a series of descriptive
	case studies on global virtual teams whose members were separated
	by location and culture, were challenged by a common collaborative
	project, and for whom the only economically and practically viable
	communication medium was asynchronous and synchronous computer-mediated
	communication. The results suggest that global virtual teams may
	experience a form of "swift" trust, but such trust appears to be
	very fragile and temporal. The study raises a number of issues to
	be explored and debated by future research. Pragmatically, the study
	describes communication behaviors that might facilitate trust in

	Certainly, the vast majority of U.S. corporations use some sort of

	index of performance or another. But more striking is the rarely
	examined belief that people will do a better job if they have been

	insiders, we find that preferences for knowledge obtained from outsiders
	are also prevalent. Two complementary case studies and survey data
	from managers demonstrate the phenomenon of valuing external knowledge
	more highly than internal knowledge and reveal some mechanisms through
	which this process occurs. We found evidence that the preference
	for outsider knowledge is the result of managerial responses to (1)
	the contrasting status implications of learning from internal versus
	external competitors, and (2) the availability of scarcity of knowledge--internal
	knowledge is more readily available and hence subject to greater
	scrutiny, while external knowledge is more scarce, which makes it
	appear more special and unique. We conclude by considering some consequences
	of the external knowledge preference for organizational functioning.

Abstract = {Much of the theory in personnel economics relates to effects of monetary incentives on output, but the theory was untested because appropriate data were unavailable. A new data set for the Safelite Glass Corporation tests the predictions that average productivity will rise, the firm will attract a more able workforce, and variance in output across individuals at the firm will rise when it shifts to piece rates. In Safelite, productivity effects amount to a 44-percent increase in output per worker. This firm apparently had selected a suboptimal compensation system, as profits also increased with the change.
