  abstract = {We consider a class of problems in which an algorithm seeks to compute
	a function f over a set of n inputs, where each input has an associated
	price. The algorithm queries inputs sequentially, trying to learn
	the value of the function for the minimum cost. We apply the competitive
	analysis of algorithms to this framework, designing algorithms that
	incur large cost only when the cost of the cheapest "proof" for the
	value of f is also large. We provide algorithms that achieve the
	optimal competitive ratio for functions that include arbitrary Boolean
	AND/OR trees, and for the problem of searching in a sorted array.
	We also investigate a model for pricing in this framework and construct,
	for every AND/OR tree, a set of prices that satisfies a very strong
	type of equilibrium property.},

  abstract = {This paper focuses on competitive function evaluation in the context
	of computing with priced information. A function f is given together
	with a cost cx for each variable x of f. The cost cx has to be paid
	to read the value of x. The problem is to design algorithms that
	query the values of the variables sequentially in order to compute
	the function while trying to minimize the total cost incurred. Competitive
	analysis is employed to evaluate the performance of the algorithms.
	We describe a novel approach for devising efficient algorithms in
	this setting. We apply our approach to several classes of functions
	which have been studied in the literature of computing with priced
	information. In all cases considered, our approach provides algorithms
	that achieve better bounds than the best known algorithm for the
	same class of functions.More precisely, for the class of monotone
	boolean functions, we give a polynomial time algorithm with extremal
	competitiveness (k+l - ¡Ì min(k,l)) where k (l) denotes the minimum
	number of variables that one must read, in the worst case, in order
	to prove that the function under consideration evaluates to 1 (0).
	This dramatically improves upon the best known result which is an
	exponential time 2 max(k, l)-competitive algorithm. For the subclass
	of monotone boolean functions known as Threshold Trees we further
	improve our bounds and give a polynomial time algorithm with extremal
	competitive ratio 1.618 max(k, l).We then apply our methodology to
	classes of non-boolean functions. We consider the case of the so
	called Game Trees. We improve upon previously published results for
	this class of functions providing a polynomial time algorithm with
	extremal competitive ratio 1.5 ¦Ã(f), where ¦Ã(f) is a lower bound
	on the extremal competitive ratio of any deterministic algorithm.Finally,
	we consider the case when f is the function min (minimum). In this
	case, we are able to determine the optimal competitiveness for the
	problem. In fact we provide an algorithm with an (n-2)-competitive
	ratio, which matches the known lower bound.},
