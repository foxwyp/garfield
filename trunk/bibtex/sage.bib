abstract = {Knowledge is now being seen as the most important strategic resource in organizations, and the management of this knowledge is considered critical to organizational success. If organizations have to capitalize on the knowledge they possess, they have to understand how knowledge is created, shared, and used within the organization. Knowledge exists and is shared at different levels in organizations. This article examines knowledge sharing at the most basic level; namely, between individuals in organizations. Based on a review of existing literature in this area, this article presents a model that identifies factors that most significantly influence knowledge sharing at this level.

abstract = {The problem and the solution . Virtual (online) communities of practice (VCoPs; when community members share and cocreate knowledge in online discussions and other forms of knowledge exchange) are increasingly viewed as important vehicles of collective learning in the workplace. Currently, factors leading to successful online knowledge sharing are not well understood. This article is based on an extensive review of online learning, knowledge management, and online communication literature, and proposes a framework for understanding motivators, barriers, and enablers for successful online knowledge sharing and learning. The framework includes key motivational factors, such as utilitarian considerations, value-based considerations, and sense of community and belonging; barriers to online knowledge sharing, including interpersonal factors, procedural and/or use of technology-related factors, and cultural norms; and enablers of VCoP knowledge sharing, including supportive organizational culture, presence of personal knowledge-based trust, and availability of adequate tools. The article concludes with specific recommendations for promoting and supporting vibrant and productive VCoPs.

abstract = {The strategic importance of knowledge sharing and its relationships with organizational and managerial (i.e. environmental) factors have been well documented. The effects of some context-specific individual factors--including interpersonal trust--on knowledge sharing have   also been investigated. The effects of enduring and pervasive individual factors (i.e, personality) on knowledge sharing have not been adequately described   empirically. This article links personality, specifically agreeableness, a broad personality domain and propensity to trust, a narrow personality facet, to knowledge  sharing via interpersonal trust, thereby clarifying substantial person-related effects within these important workplace phenomena.

abstract = {We examine the implications of virtual customer environments for supporting the innovation process. By building on the literature of knowledge brokers, we introduce   the concept of virtual knowledge brokers--actors who leverage the internet to support third parties' innovation activities. These actors enable firms   to extend their reach in engaging with customers and they also allow firms to have a richer dialogue with customers because of their perceived neutrality. Consequently,  virtual knowledge brokers help firms to complement the knowledge they can acquire through traditional physical and virtual channels for customer interaction. We   highlight the capabilities and contributions of virtual knowledge brokers, and we discuss the implications of these entities for theory and practice in the management of innovation.

abstract = {At a time when the civil services of most OECD countries have embarked on a process of modernization of their practices, we are questioning the relevance of introducing performance-related pay systems, particularly in view of the, more often than not, negative effects on the work motivation of civil servants. The French civil service has recently decided to pay a part of its public officials on the basis of their performance, and we show how these individualized remuneration practices can, in the long term, undermine the public service motivations that drive some civil servants. Our reasoning is supported by the empirical results of studies conducted in the United States, in England and also in France, as well as on the developments of intrinsic motivation theories, combined with the developments of the public service motivation theory.  Points for the practitioners  Whereas the implementation of performance-related pay as an instrument of motivation has become widespread within the civil service, this article focuses on the difficulties inherent to these compensation practices. We underline in particular the negative effects of performance-related pay on the public service motivations of civil servants. As these specific motivations can be pushed aside, human resource management tools should be adopted that encourage the development of intrinsic motivation, such as task enlargement or enrichment or the implementation of participative management methods.
