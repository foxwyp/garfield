	Till now the classical intellectual capital (IC) model and its applications
	has dealt with three categories: human, structural and relationship
	capital. The paper takes a step further in the evolution of the IC
	model for the hotel industry and divides relationship capital into
	two categories: end-customer-relationship capital that only refers
	to relations with end-customers and non-end-customer-relationship
	capital that embraces relations with all the other customers and/or
	partners. Such an approach enabled us to measure the influence of
	each IC category on the financial performance of hotel firms separately.
	The application of this model in the Slovenian hotel industry showed
	positive correlations between all pairs of IC categories. Although
	the total IC has a significant impact on financial performance, the
	study shows that only end-customer relationships proved to have a
	strong direct impact on financial results. The study suggests that
	Slovenian hotel management should improve IC by investment in human
	capital and information technology, both of which are connected to
	the urgent need for speeding up the process of direct distribution
	channels development in the category of end-customer-relationship
	capital, thereby directly influencing the financial performance of
	Slovenian hotel firms.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates issues concerning the definition and valuation
	of knowledge assets. It starts by reviewing several approaches to
	defining knowledge assets more precisely. These include human resource
	accounting, organizational learning and intellectual property. Next
	an inventory is made of how the valuation problem is handled in practice,
	focusing on corporate practices, venture capital practice and commercial
	banking practices. From there a new framework for knowledge assets
	is developed based on relevant differences between human resource
	assets and intellectual property. Subsequently a method is described
	for valuing knowledge assets at a level of detail that is relevant
	for knowledge management. This method uses the added value and the
	cost of a knowledge asset as the main contributors to value. For
	establishing the cost of a knowledge asset, use is made of activity
	based costing. Additionally some limitations of the method are discussed.},

  abstract = {A knowledge service consists of systematic knowledge and the mechanism
	of using knowledge to perform a task. The supply of knowledge services
	forms a knowledge service layer over the knowledge flow network formed
