  abstract = {Pursuing a nodal (i.e., subsidiary) level of analysis, this paper
	advances and tests an overarching theoretical framework pertaining
	to intracorporate knowledge transfers within multinational corporations
	(MNCs). We predicted that (i) knowledge outflows from a subsidiary
	would be positively associated with value of the subsidiarys knowledge
	stock, its motivational disposition to share knowledge, and the richness
	of transmission channels; and (ii) knowledge inflows into a subsidiary
	would be positively associated with richness of transmission channels,
	motivational disposition to acquire knowledge, and the capacity to
	absorb the incoming knowledge. These predictions were tested empirically
	with data from 374 subsidiaries within 75 MNCs headquartered in the
	U.S., Europe, and Japan. Except for our predictions regarding the
	impact of source unit's motivational disposition on knowledge outflows,
	the data provide either full or partial support to all of the other
	elements of our theoretical framework. Copyright Â© 2000 John Wiley

  volume = {23},
  pages = {689 - 706},
  number = {8},
  abstract = {Managing knowledge inventories is the central issue posed by the knowledge-based
	view of the firm. Knowledge inventory management involves acquiring,
	retaining, deploying, idling, and abandoning technologies. Because
	of future opportunities to switch technologies over time, managing
	knowledge inventories requires valuing flexibility. Real option theory
	presents normative conceptual frameworks and pricing formulas for
	valuing flexibility. These formulas assume managers consider the
	full time horizon of technologies as well as all available substituting
	and complementary technologies. This study considers the implications
	of violations of these assumptions (i.e., temporal and spatial myopia)
	for managers' technology investment decisions. Specifying decision
	criteria under alternative forms of myopia reveals possible sources
	and patterns of technology management decision errors. This study
	highlights the cognitive sources of path dependencies and organizational
	rigidities.},
