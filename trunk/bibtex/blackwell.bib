  abstract = {Based on a sample of 102 US organizations, this study examines the
	impact of knowledge characteristics, recipient learning intent, source
	attractiveness, and relationship quality on the effectiveness and
	efficiency of knowledge transfer from the international business
	affiliates of these organizations. Findings indicate that recipient
	learning intent and source attractiveness positively impact the effectiveness
	of knowledge transfer. In addition, recipient learning intent was
	found to have a positive effect on knowledge transfer efficiency.
	In particular, results highlight the strong positive impact that
	the quality of the relationship between the source and the recipient
	has on both the efficiency and effectiveness of cross-border knowledge
	transfer. The study also indicates that knowledge value is positively
	associated with recipient learning intent and that knowledge value,
	rarity and non-substitutability influence source attractiveness.
	Finally, findings suggest that the relationship between knowledge
	characteristics and knowledge transfer is partially mediated by recipient
	learning intent and source attractiveness.},
