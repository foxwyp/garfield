  abstract = {We examine a knowledge management (KM) success model that incorporates
	the quality of available knowledge and KM systems built to share
	and reuse knowledge such as determinants of users' perception of
	usefulness and user satisfaction with an organization's KM practices.
	Perceived usefulness and user satisfaction, in turn, affect knowledge
	use, which in our model is a measure of how well knowledge sharing
	and reuse activities are internalized by an organization. Our model
	includes organizational support structure as a contributing factor
	to the success of KM system implementation. Data collected from 150
	knowledge workers from a variety of organizations confirmed 10 of
	13 hypothesized relationships. Notably, the organizational support
	factors of leadership commitment, supervisor and coworker support,
	as well as incentives, directly or indirectly supported shared knowledge
	quality and knowledge use. In line with the proposed model, the study
	lends support to the argument that, in addition to KM systems quality,
	firms must pay careful attention to championing and goal setting
	as well as designing adequate reward systems for the ultimate success
	of these efforts. This is one of the first studies that encompasses
	both the supply (knowledge contribution) and demand (knowledge reuse)
	sides of KM in the same model. It provides more than anecdotal evidence
	of factors that determine successful KM system implementations. Unlike
	earlier studies that only deal with knowledge-sharing incentives
	or quality of shared knowledge, we present and empirically validate
	an integrated model that includes knowledge sharing and knowledge
	quality and their links to the desired outcome¡ªnamely, knowledge
	reuse.},
