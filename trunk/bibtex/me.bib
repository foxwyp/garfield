Abstract = {{To enhance the efficiency and accuracy of knowledge acquisition, based
   on the aviation product failure analysis, a knowledge acquisition
   framework is proposed. Sentence templates are defined to extract the
   meta-knowledge and RDF is used to manage the extracted knowledge. Then
   domain concepts are discovered from RDF documents by using LSI-SVD and
   taxonomy knowledge are found through domain text analysis by using a
   text clustering method named as dominant-set. At last, a prototype is
   developed to acquire knowledge from failure analysis reports of
   aviation product. Empirical results show that the framework can acquire
   knowledge from domain text efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge inventory management is nowadays central issue as knowledge
   management becomes vital for organizations. Knowledge inventory
   management involves acquiring, retaining, deploying, idling, and
   abandoning technologies. Managers must make investment decisions about
   which technologies should be involved into inventory for future usage.
   Options-pricing model (OPM) has been widely accepted to make investment
   decisions. An alternative technology is regarded as an option to switch
   technologies to deal with future contingencies. This paper studies
   another kind of knowledge inventory problem which OPM is sort of
   inefficient to deal with. An organization might be forced to invest in
   some technology in the future because of some specific incident occurs,
   thus option is replaced by obligation. The characteristics of this kind
   of problem are portrayed and we show why OPM is not applicable. We
   treat the specific incident as an insurance accident to organizations
   and initial investment in some technology as insurance fee which can
   cover the loss when accident occurs. We use actuarial model to analyze
   the problem and give the evaluation methods in different conditions.}},
